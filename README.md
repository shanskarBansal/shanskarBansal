### Hey, I'm Shanskar 👋

I'm a **Senior Consultant & Data Scientist** at [Varahe Analytics](https://varaheanalytics.com), where I spend most of my time building tools that pull insights out of messy, real-world data — social media posts, salary surveys, engagement metrics, you name it.

I got into data because I genuinely enjoy the detective work. Figuring out *why* a campaign underperformed or *what* drives engagement on a platform — that's the kind of problem I like waking up to.

When I'm not wrangling datasets, I'm usually tinkering with scraping pipelines, experimenting with LLMs, or building small full-stack apps just because it's fun.

**What I'm working on these days:**

- Building enterprise analytics dashboards that process data from Instagram, Facebook, YouTube & X
- Designing scraping systems with Playwright & Apify that don't fall apart at scale
- Exploring RAG pipelines and LLM-powered workflows for smarter data analysis
- Maintaining a salary prediction tool ([Worthify.me](https://github.com/shanskarBansal/SalaryLens-Showcase)) that uses ML to estimate developer compensation

### Projects

Most of my source code lives in private repos (client work), but I maintain public showcases with docs, architecture diagrams, and screenshots:

### A bit about my background

I work at the intersection of data science and engineering. At Varahe, I've built systems that:

- Scrape and process millions of social media data points across 4+ platforms
- Power real-time dashboards used by marketing and strategy teams
- Predict salary ranges using trained ML models
- Automate reporting pipelines that used to take days down to minutes

Before getting deep into data science, I built full-stack web apps with Node.js and MongoDB — and I still enjoy that side of things. Having backend experience makes me better at building data tools that actually work in production, not just in notebooks.
